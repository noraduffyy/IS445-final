IS 445- Data Visualization

Final Project

Biggest Takeaway from this class:
My biggest takeaway from this course was definitely the scope of different visualization types and the different tools and 
packages that can be used to achieve different goals. The weekly visaulisation reports opened my eyes to the possibilities 
of visualizing data, and our work with BQPlot and MatPlotLib showed me that you can achieve different types and styles of 
visualizations using different packages in Python. It also proved to me how many resources exist online to aid in the process 
of learning data visualization. Prior to this course, I had created visualizations for linear regressions as well as logistic 
regressions, but these were more statistically based than focused on the way to create a visualization.

Things Professor Uhe could improve on as a teacher:
Professor Uhe could teach more specific technical skills and quiz us on specific code or different forms of visualizations.
I felt that there lacked a depth of information, and the course felt more like guidance for discovering how to complete 
visualizations on your own. I would prefer to take away a more concrete set of skills from a course.
